/*Wherefore art thou
Make a function that looks through an array of objects (first argument) and 
returns an array of all objects that have matching name and value pairs (second argument). 
Each name and value pair of the source object has to be present in the object from the collection if it is to be included in the returned array.

For example, 
if the first argument is [{ first: "Romeo", last: "Montague" }, { first: "Mercutio", last: null }, { first: "Tybalt", last: "Capulet" }], 
and the second argument is { last: "Capulet" }, then you must return the third object from the array (the first argument), 
because it contains the name and its value, that was passed on as the second argument.

/*Code Explanation
We filter through the array using .filter().
Using a for loop we loop through each item in the object.
We use a if statement to check if the object in the collection doesn’t have the key and the property value doesn’t match the value in source.
We return false if the above if statement is correct. Otherwise, we return true;

We start by filtering through collection using Array.filter().
Next, we map through all keys and 
  return Boolean values based on the check conditions: both the key and its corresponding value must exist within the object we are filtering through.
Then we reduce the mapped Boolean values to a single Boolean that indicates whether all srcKeys pass the conditions checked above.
This single Boolean will be used to filter through the collection.
