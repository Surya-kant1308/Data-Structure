/*We start off with a simple if statement to determine one of two outcomesâ€¦
If our string length is greater than the num we want to truncate it, 
we return a slice of our string starting at character 0, and ending at num. 
We then append our '...' to the end of the string.
However, if above situation is not true, it means our string length is less than our truncation num. 
Therefore, we can just return the string.

/*This solution is very similar to basic solution. 
To determine the new string, we use a ternary operator. 
In our ternary operation, if str.length is larger than num, 
we return a new string which is slice of our string starting at character 0, 
and ending at num and the '...' is appended to the end of our new string. 
If str.length is less than or equal to num, we return the string without any truncation.
