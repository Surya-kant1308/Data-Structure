//Using the split() function will turn our string into an array of characters, keep that in mind as we move forward.
//Next we chain the reverse() function, which takes our array of characters and reverses them.
//Finally, we chain join('') to put our characters back together into a string. 
//Notice once again that we left no spaces in the argument for join, 
//this makes sure that the array of characters is joined back together by each character.
